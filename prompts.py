# summary prompt for making a summary of the review
SUMMARY_PROMPT = """
Your goal is to identify the key concerns raised in the list of reviews, focusing only on potential

Please provide your analysis in JSON format, including a concise summary, and the exact
wording from the review. 
    
Submission Title: {Title}

=====Review:

## ============================ REVIEW_COMPARISON_RPOMPT ============================ ##

REVIEW_COMPARISON_RPOMPT = """
Your task is to carefully analyze and accurately match the key concerns raised in two reviews, 
ensuring a strong correspondence between the matched points. Examine the verbatim closely.

=====Review A: 
{Review_A}

===== 

=====Review B: 
{Review_B}

===== 

Please follow the example JSON format below for matching points. For instance, if point from review A is nearly identical to point from review B, it should look like this:
{{ 
    "A3-B2": {{"rationale": "<explain why A3 and B2 are nearly identical>","similarity": "<5-10, only an integer>"}},
    ...
}}

**Note that you should only match points with a significant degree of similarity in their concerns. Refrain from matching points with only superficial similarities or weak connections.** For each matched pair, rate the similarity on a scale of 5-10:
- 5 Somewhat Related: Points address similar themes but from different angles.
- 6 Moderately Related: Points share a common theme but with different perspectives or suggestions.
- 7 Strongly Related: Points are largely aligned but differ in some details or nuances.
- 8 Very Strongly Related: Points offer similar suggestions or concerns, with slight differences.
- 9 Almost Identical: Points are nearly the same, with minor differences in wording or presentation.
- 10 Identical: Points are exactly the same in terms of concerns, suggestions, or praises.

If no match is found, output an empty JSON object. Provide your output as JSON only.
